The Task Management System is a simple console-based Java application that helps users manage their daily tasks effectively.
It allows users to add, view, update, complete, and delete tasks after a successful login.

This mini project was developed using Java as part of an academic submission and demonstrates basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, and modularity.
